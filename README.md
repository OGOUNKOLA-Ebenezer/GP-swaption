#  Constrained Gaussian Process for Swaption Cube Calibration

###  A machine learning approach for building an arbitrage-free swaption cube under shape constraints

---

##  Overview

This project implements a **Constrained Gaussian Process (GP)** model for reconstructing a smooth, arbitrage-free **swaption cube** of prices (or implied volatilities).  
It enforces **financially consistent constraints** â€” monotonicity and convexity â€” directly during the optimization.

The model is based on a **finite-dimensional GP approximation** using a **MatÃ©rn 5/2 kernel** and **tri-linear hat basis functions**, following the methodology of *Bachoc et al. (2019)* and *Maatouk & Bay (2017)*.
